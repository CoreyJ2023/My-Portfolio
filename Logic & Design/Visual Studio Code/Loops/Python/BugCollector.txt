	Programming Excercise 01: Bug Collector
	Programmer: Corey Jenkins    Date: 03-22-2017
	Purpose: to create a program using a module, that runs a loop of seven days
	and putting in how many bugs you've collected a day.
**/

Module main()
	Call totalBugs
End Module

Function totalBugs

// Bring three variables. Two of which we'll assign for "days" as a counter and the "bugs"
// variable to input the amount collected within seven days.
Declare Integer bugs, days

// The total will begin at zero and will add up.
set Integer total = 0

// using a for loop, the first day is set to 1 and will loop until it reaches the 7th day
// which is 7.

For(days = 1 to days step 2)

// With the for loop, enter a number of bugs you have collected
// and it will add up for seven days.

Display "bugs collected." 
Input bugs
total = total + bugs

Display "The amount of bugs collected within seven days are, total"
End For
End Function
